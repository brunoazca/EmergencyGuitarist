## 🏆 Project Overview

Imagine you're at a rock concert, and the lead guitarist can’t make it. You step in and experience a quick but intense two-minute crash course on how to play the guitar through a playable virtual instrument. After mastering the basics, it's time to feel the energy of the show by playing alongside other instruments, right in front of the crowd!

## 💡 Motivation

The inspiration for this project came from my volunteer work at the **Fazendo Arte** NGO, where I've been teaching guitar to people of all ages living in challenging conditions.  
During lessons, we often lacked enough guitars for everyone to practice, but most students had smartphones — devices with immense educational potential. This realization led me to create **Emergency Guitarist**, aiming to digitize and democratize access to music education by removing common barriers such as the lack of instruments or available teachers.
